# Electronic medical record with drug-drug interactions for clinical decision support system
## Project Description
Normally when a patient visits a clinic for the first time the receptionist takes the patient's information and their medical history including the patientâ€™s medications list. the target of our graduation project is to build a software in the form of a website and a cross platform mobile application. this software will be used by healthcare professionals working in clinics, so during the visit the doctor can see the medical history of the patients and what medications they are taking also the doctor can click on a certain medicine to see information about it, and also while prescribing a new drug for the patient, the application will check any interactions between the prescribed drug and the medications list of the patient to inform the doctor about the details of each possible interaction. This software will work as a computerized clinical decision support system to support and prevent doctors from prescribing drugs that may interact in a dangerous way.
